## Current Implementation State

The server of TuneFull runs with OAuth 2.0 authentication on all intended endpoints. Endpoints are in use for the procurement of all necessary client-side information. The client-side app is in early stages: the navigation scheme has been chosen and authentication has been set up. Multiple successful round trips have been made between client and server. The server is currently unable to test certain endpoints, such as relationships. Certain other endpoints such as a single put and delete endpoint are not yet working.
