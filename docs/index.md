## Summary

The TuneFull music network bundles together fun and discovery to provide its users with a positive and friendly music sharing experience. Tune in to share 20-30 second clips of music that match your mood, and see what music clips your friends are sharing. You can also listen to clips posted by people outside your friend circle to discover new music, or follow those with similar taste.

## Current implementation state

The server of TuneFull runs, with OAuth 2.0 authentication on all intended endpoints. It has endpoints to get all the information that is anticipated to be needed on the client-side. The client-side app is in early stages: the navigation scheme has been chosen and authentication has been set up. A successful roundtrip between client and server can be made.
