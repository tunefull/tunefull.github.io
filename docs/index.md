### Server functionality 

The server hosts the database, and provides data to the client when requested. This includes data such as users, friends, follows, feeds of clip posts by the user's friends and follows, or a feed of clip posts from non-friend users for use in the discovery feature. The server also saves and updates with client-provided input, including clip posts, genre mood updates, and friend requests/accepts.

### Client functionality

Once logged in, users have access to a feed of recent clips posted by those on the network. Additionally, they can post 30 second sound bites of music which are added to their profile. Clicking on a clip allows the user to listen and discover information about the artist, song and album. Users are also able to perform a variety of relationship actions such as adding or deleting friends and follows.
