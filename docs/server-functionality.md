## Server Functionality 

The server will host the database, and will provide data to the client when requested. This data might include a list of the user's friends, a feed of clip posts by the user's friends and follows, or a feed of clip posts from non-friend users for use in the discovery feature. The server will take and store input from the client, including clip posts and friend requests/accepts.
