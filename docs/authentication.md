## Authentication scheme

The authentication scheme used is Google Sign-in ([Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating)). Sign-in lets the user log into the app with their Google account. The client app authenticates with Google and passes the authentication token on to the server. Sign-in is required for full usage of the app.
