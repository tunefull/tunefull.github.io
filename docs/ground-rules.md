* Core practices for coordination
>  * Meeting twice a week via Zoom
>    * T/Th after class, with flexibility
>  * Text-based communication through Slack, texting, email
>  * Scrum standups at the beginning of each meeting
>    * Decide on/review development goals and possible implementations directly after scrums

* Choosing/Assigning/Accepting Development Tasks
>  * Either a queue system or a ticket system
>  * Dividing tasks into at least two, possibly four queues or categories (i.e. server-side data, server-side web services, client-side data, client-side UI)
>  * Team leader can assign tasks *if needed*
  
* Conflict resolution
>  * Communication before conflicts happen
>  * Communication between the two parties, with the third member as mediator if necessary
>  * For conflicts that remain unresolved, contacting DeepDive staff (Nick, Todd, Rishita, Sue)
>  * If negotiations fail, _**TRIAL BY COMBAT**_

* Branches/merging
> * Feature branches (with lots of communication between members working on the same feature)
> * Merging: always communicate before merging to master (or to a shared feature branch) and make sure to pull before pushing.
