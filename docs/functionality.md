## Functionality

**Client Functionality**

Once logged in, users are able to perform a variety of actions such as adding or deleting friends and follows. Users have access to a feed of recent clips posted by those on the network. Additionally, they can post 20 to 30 second sound bites of music which are added to their profile. Just click on a clip to listen and discover information about the artist, song and album. Users who are not logged in can access this feature to some extent, but are not able to follow and friend other users, or post their own music. The app also includes settings such as color themes.
    	
**Server Functionality**

The server will host the database, and will provide data to the client when requested. This data might include a list of the user's friends, a feed of clip posts by the user's friends and follows, or a feed of clip posts from non-friend users for use in the discovery feature. The server will take and store input from the client, including clip posts and friend requests/accepts.
