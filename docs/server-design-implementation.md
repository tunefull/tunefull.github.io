## Server-side design and implementation

### Server functionality 

The server hosts the database, and provides data to the client when requested. This includes data such as a list of the user's friends, a feed of clip posts by the user's friends and follows, or a feed of clip posts from non-friend users for use in the discovery feature. The server also saves and updates with client-provided input, including clip posts and friend requests/accepts.
